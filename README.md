## Syntax

```
BudgetManager.jar
```
NOTE: the purchases.txt file needs to exist in the same folder as the jar file.

## Stages
**Stage 1 Count my money**    
Read your purchases from the console and print the total amount.

**Stage 2 Make a menu**   
A menu is like the face of the application. At this stage, your task is to make a user-friendly menu for your program. 

**Stage 3 Oh the things you can buy**    
Make your manager smarter: create categories for your purchases to better analyze the user’s spending habits

**Stage 4 Memorable purchases**    
Planning the budget is a lasting activity: enable your program to keep the history of expenses over time.

**Stage 5 Analyzer**    
Teach your program to perform a concise analysis of income and spendings. Now that’s what we call “budget planning”!
